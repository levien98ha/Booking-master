Creating a custom hanging herb chandelier and dessert takeaways will really impress your guests at this year’s seasonal get-together.\n\nCreate a rustic vibe by wrapping the dining table in brown kraft paper. Arrange leaves, loaves of bread and open bottles of wine along the center of this setup. Lovely butter knives atop neatly placed cloth napkins seal the deal.\n\nServe tea or coffee with your homemade treat bags after the meal to brighten everyone’s day. Taking the little bit of time to make this thoughtful goody that your guests can break into right away or take home really makes visitors feel special. Taffy, cookies or a slice of pie are all great sweets to bag up for later."

But if not, think about adding some considerate touches that will make parents more comfortable and alleviate kid boredom.\n\nHere are some ideas to get you started:\n\nTurn a spare room or an upstairs bedroom into a private nursing/changing area for a new mom.\nToddlers and younger children will want to be near their parents, so a good idea for them is to set up a corner of your living or dining room with toys, books, a tablet for watching cartoons and some comfy pillows or throws.\nOne of our favorite strategies for older kids is to turn the dessert course into an activity. For instance, you could bake a huge batch of sugar cookies in holiday shapes, and then put out different colors of icing to let kids (and adults) go to town with decorating their own cookies."

Nothing is worse than buying a home thinking you can fix the yard for a few hundred dollars and then realizing it will cost thousands.\n\nThere’s really no limit to how prepared you can be. Say you find a nice home that’s priced lower than others in the area because of its age. You may save money on the list price, but with an older house, you could be slapped with a much higher home insurance payment, making the house more expensive in the long run."

            "decription": "In the 1940s, this Huntington Beach water tower — which stands at around 100 feet tall — serviced the local trains that came through town, connecting the inner city to the beach. Today, it’s a 3,500-square-foot high-rise with unmatched views of the Pacific Ocean, downtown Los Angeles and Catalina Island.\n\nThe historic and beloved water tower has long been a fixture of the Huntington coastline, but it was nearly torn down in the 1980s — until the local community pulled together and demanded it be saved.\n\n“There was a huge community outcry to keep it,” said Scott Ostlund, the owner of the water tower home. “People were selling quilts and having meetings on ‘Save Our Water Tower.’”"
